## Laboratory for Structure and Dynamics

<img src="/img/networks.png?height=137&amp;width=320" border="0" width="100%">

Our research deals with the interaction and coevolution of structure and dynamics. Our focus is on network theory, but also general nonlinear dynamics in structured systems. Examples include social networks interacting with the spread of diseases and ideas, the shape of forests coevolving with forest fires, and the structure of metabolic networks influencing interactions in microbial communities.
