## Laboratory for Structure and Dynamics

<img src="/img/networks.png?height=137&amp;width=320" border="0" width="100%">

My group is a member of the [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/). Our research focuses on the coevolution of structure and dynamics in complex systems. Recent examples include theoretical work on interacting contagions, network comparison, spread of ideas and creativity, as well as applied projects on infectious diseases, how the shape of forests coevolves with forest fires, and how the structure of metabolic networks drive the organization of microbial communities. Visit the [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/) website for more details.
