title: New projects in the pipeline
---

I have two new projects on the arXiv, both with only very good friends. The
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00801" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">first</a>
is a new adaptive network project to describe novel patterns that we found in influenza transmission. The 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08542" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">second</a>
is a new network analysis algorithm which helps us look at different scales of organization at a glance. We have a lot of cool ideas in the work using this algorithm. Finally, a very interesting ecology project should be online soon. Stay tuned!
