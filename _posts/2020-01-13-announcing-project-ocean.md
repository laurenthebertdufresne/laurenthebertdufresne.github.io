title: Announcing Project OCEAN with Google Open Source
---

[Jim Bagrow](http://bagrow.com/), [Juniper Lovato](http://juniperlovato.com/), myself and others at the Vermont Complex Systems Center are incredibly excited to announce a new project in collaboration with [Google Open Source](https://opensource.google/), which we are calling Project OCEAN: Open-source Complex Ecosystems and Networks. Our team, supported in part by a $1 million gift from Google, will study how open communities emerge, grow, evolve, create and thrive. We just opened a couple of fully funded [postdoctoral fellowships](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/funding/) to help us explore this huge research space.
