title: New NSF grant on network comparison
---

[Joshua Grochow](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~jgrochow/index.html) and I were awarded a grant from NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences. Our project is titled [Network Comparison, a Cornerstone of the Foundations of Network Science](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1622390&HistoricalAwards=false). We should start the real work in the next few months, and we aim to come up with model-free tools of network comparison. To quote ourselves: "To break new ground, we must think in terms of structural distance rather than statistical inference."
