title: New papers on the arXiv
---

We have added our recent contributions on the bond percolation problem (
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4369" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Exact solution of bond percolation on small arbitrary graphs</a>
 and 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4602" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bond percolation on a class of correlated and clustered random graphs</a>
) and on the description of disease propagation (
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0296" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Epidemics on contact networks: a general stochastic approach</a>
) on the arXiv. The titles speak for themselves...
