title: NetSci 2019
---

NetSci 2019 is less than three weeks away! My Laboratory for Structure and Dynamics will be well represented with 3 talks and 2 posters. Brendan Case will be giving an oral presentation titled "Modelling Disease Spillover Using Multipartite Networks", Jean-Gabriel Young will talk about "Compression of treelike complex networks using layered configuration models", and Guillaume St-Onge about "Mesoscopic localization of spreading processes on networks". In the poster sessions, Blake Williams will present on "Resistance to Strain-Transcending Immunity in Viral Genotype Networks" and Sam Rosenblatt on "Viable Targeted Immunization Strategies in Complex Networks: Addressing the Boundary Specification Problem".
