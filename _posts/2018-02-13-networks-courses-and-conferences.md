title: Networks of courses and conferences

A lot is happening on the network education front! Computer science students (and others) at the University of Vermont are currently 5 weeks into my new Algorithms for Complex Networks course. We are also currently planning and accepting contributed presentations for [Contagion & Networks 2018](https://networkscontagion.github.io/), the second edition of our NetSci satellite event. Finally, I hope to announce a much larger network education project over the next few months! Stay tuned.
