title: On NetSci 2014, Québec and Santa Fe.
---

Very happy that our poster " [Complex Networks are an Emerging Property of Hierarchical Preferential Attachment](http://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/posters/netsci2014_poster_lhd.pdf) " won an "Outstanding poster" award at NetSci 2014 in Berkeley. Jean-Gabriel also shined with an excellent talk, his very first, on our 'organic' model of community structure growth. Now I'm back to oscillating between Santa Fe and Québec to finish that thesis.
