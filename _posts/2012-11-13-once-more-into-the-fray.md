title: Once more into the fray
---

Antoine Allard and I will be leaving once again for Santa Fe in early December for the 2nd International Conference on Complex Sciences. I will be presenting preliminary results of my research [on the growth of critical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1361) and Antoine will be presenting some results of Jean-Gabriel Young's ongoing effort in [community detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1364) .
