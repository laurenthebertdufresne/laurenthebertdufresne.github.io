title: The Effective Structure of Complex Networks
---

Antoine Allard and I recently published our latest project, [Percolation and the Effective Structure of Complex Networks](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.011023), in Physical Review X. Premiering at NetSci 2019, Jean-Gabriel Young will present some recent work on the same topic: Compression of treelike complex networks using layered configuration models. Altogether, the concept of network layers appears to be an efficient model (or compression) of real sparse networks. We are very excited about some of the possible applications, from temporal inference on phylogenetic data to network comparison. Stay tuned!
