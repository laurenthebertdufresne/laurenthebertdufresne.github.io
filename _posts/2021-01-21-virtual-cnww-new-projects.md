title: Virtual CNWW, and real new projects
---

Our team led by the great [Juniper Lovato](http://juniperlovato.com) recently wrapped up our Virtual Complex Network Winter Workshop (or [CNWW](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/cnww/)) which I thought was an amazing experience. One of our participant collected a [summary of the projects on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/events/1350531996120801282). Speaking of collaborations and teamwork, we are also looking to the future: Our OCEAN project is now focusing on attribution of contributions in open source projects (see our piece in [Nature Computational Science](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-020-00011-w)) as well as distributing [funding to related projects](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/partner/OCEAN/awards/). Exciting times ahead!
