[New paper out in PRE](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.012314) with Uttam Bhat and Munik Shrestha. We open an interesting new problem: Why is the emergence of k-core continuous in networks with triadic closure (transitive linking)? We find that triangles alone do not account for the richness of the phase transitions we observe, which hints at the critical role of overlapping triangles (non-trivial motifs). We are in dire need of better analytical tools to account for these overlapping motifs. To be continued...
