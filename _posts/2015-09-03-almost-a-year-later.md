title: Almost a year later
---

It's been a while since the last update. Let's just say I am super
excited about many projects started in my first year at the Santa Fe 
Institute. One of the smaller ones was published a few days ago in 
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/10551.abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PNAS</a>

(open-access). The big result: interacting epidemics (or other 
dynamics) can spread faster on clustered network than on an (otherwise 
equivalent) unclustered network! SFI had a nice 
<a href="http://santafe.edu/news/item/paper-when-isolated-groups-fuel-epidemics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">write-up</a>
on it.
