title: Almost a year later
---

It's been a while since the last update. Let's just say I am super excited about many projects started in my first year at the Santa Fe Institute. One of the smaller ones was published a few days ago in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/10551.abstract) (open-access). The big result: interacting epidemics (or other dynamics) can spread faster on clustered network than on an (otherwise equivalent) unclustered network! SFI had a nice [write-up](http://santafe.edu/news/item/paper-when-isolated-groups-fuel-epidemics/) on it.
