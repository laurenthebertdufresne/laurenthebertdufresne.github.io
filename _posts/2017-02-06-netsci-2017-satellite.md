title: NetSci 2017 Satellite
---

Antoine Allard, Ben Althouse, Sam Scarpino and I are organizing a satellite conference for [NetSci 2017](http://netsci2017.net/) called [Contagion on Networks 2017](https://contnet2017.github.io/) and focused on the dynamics of contagion. We are already receiving abstracts, and will fully consider all contributions sent to us before March 12.
