Back from [SFI's Complex Systems Winter School in India](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/events/workshops/index.php/Complex_Systems_Winter_School_2015) where I lecture on statistical physics and network theory. Two new projects were published while I was away: our [Hierarchical Preferential Attachment model](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.062809) (with a [figure](http://journals.aps.org/pre/kaleidoscope/pre/92/6/062809) highlighted by PRE) and our [most exhaustive and hardcore network ensemble allowing exact solution of bond percolation](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.062807) to date.
