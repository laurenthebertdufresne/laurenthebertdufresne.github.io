title: Vermont Complex Systems Center to host NetSci 2019
---

There is a storm brewing in Vermont! We have so many incredible projects in the pipeline, including the organization of [NetSci 2019](http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/netsci/)! It will be a pleasure to host the world's leading experts in network science in Burlington. The conference will be organized by Juniper Lovato while Peter Dodds and myself will serve as co-chairs. You can expect the conference to reflect our center: open, kind and fun.

Our other events are also listed on our website at [http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/](http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/), and you can also find the various degrees we offer (undergraduate to PhD) by using the education tab of our website.
