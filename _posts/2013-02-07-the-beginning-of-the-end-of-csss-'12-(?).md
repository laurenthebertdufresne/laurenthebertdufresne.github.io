New projects are moving forward and old projects are coming to an end. The first of our papers written during the Santa Fe Institute Complex System Summer School (2012) has been published.

Head over to the publication page for more details or jump straight to the [paper](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002912) .
