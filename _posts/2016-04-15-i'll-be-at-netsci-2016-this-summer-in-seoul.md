title: I'll be at NetSci 2016 this summer in Seoul

I'll be talking about a new voter model project (with Dynamica alumni and Eric Libby) that has been getting a lot of attention here at SFI. I'll also present the [Onion Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04632) in one of the parallel sessions. Jean-Gabriel Young will talk about our recent work on the stochastic block model, Dan Larremore will unveil our secret project on the detection of dominance and influence hierarchies in networks, and Sam Scarpino will talk about our somewhat controversial [influenza model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00801).

Should be fun!
