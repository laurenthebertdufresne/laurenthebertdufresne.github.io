Another paper of my CSSS12 group was published, again on antiviral resistance but without networks this time. Head over to the PLOS ONE website to have a look at Oscar's paper on [Optimizing Treatment Regimes to Hinder Antiviral Resistance in Influenza across Time Scales](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059529) . Most interesting result (for me): a treatment regime minimizing risk of resistance emergence is obtained analytically without considering any network structure, yet the result is valid for simulations on heterogeneous networks (even though the epidemic threshold of the resistant strain depends highly on this heterogeneity of the contact structure).
