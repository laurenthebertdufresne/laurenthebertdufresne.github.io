title: New paper in Physical Review E
---

My new paper, which is a follow-up to our
<a href="http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v107/i15/e158702" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">last paper in PRL</a>
, has been published in Physical Review E. Its apt, but long, title is: 
<b>Structural preferential attachment: stochastic process for the growth of scale-free, modular and self-similar systems</b>
. You can find it 
<a href="http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v85/i2/e026108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>
.
