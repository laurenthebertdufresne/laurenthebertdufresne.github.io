title: New paper in Physical Review E
---

My new paper, which is a follow-up to our [last paper in PRL](http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v107/i15/e158702) , has been published in Physical Review E. Its apt, but long, title is: **Structural preferential attachment: stochastic process for the growth of scale-free, modular and self-similar systems** . You can find it [here](http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v85/i2/e026108) .
