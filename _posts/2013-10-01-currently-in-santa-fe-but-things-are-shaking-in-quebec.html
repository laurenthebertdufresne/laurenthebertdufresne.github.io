Currently
 at the Santa Fe Institute for a one month visit which is already very 
interesting. But in Québec, the Dynamica group has uploaded a new paper 
on the arXiv. In 
	<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coexistence of phases and the observability of random graphs</a>
,
 we use a version of Antoine's formalism for bond percolation on 
multitype graphs to investigate "depth-L percolation", where observing 
one node implies observing his neighbours up to a distance L. 
Interestingly, extensive components can coexist! Meaning that 
	<b>monitoring a macroscopic portion of a
graph does not prevent a macroscopic event to occur unbeknown to the observer</b>
. In your face NSA!</div>
