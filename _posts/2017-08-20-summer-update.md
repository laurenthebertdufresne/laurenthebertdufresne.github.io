Two very interesting papers were published this month. The first is a Zika project with the [Contagion on Networks](https://contnet2017.github.io/) team showing that the asymmetric transmission across sexes leads to a double epidemic transitions; the paper was published in [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/08/07/1703073114.full). The second one is the result of an SFI working group, which started by studying the strategies of algae life cycles and ended up re-discovering game theory by studying political dynamics on modular networks; this crazy paper was published in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07621-x).
