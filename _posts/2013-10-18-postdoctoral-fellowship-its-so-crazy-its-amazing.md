title: 'Postdoctoral Fellowship: It''s so crazy, it''s amazing!'
---

Things are moving forward at an incredible speed. A lot of projects were started, and a few were completed, during my 5 weeks stay at the Santa Fe Institute. I can't wait to put some of those projects online. I've also been selected by the [James S. McDonnell Foundation for their Postdoctoral Fellowship Awards in Studying Complex Systems](http://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/index.php) . I'm not sure where I'll have the pleasure of continuing my research, "but I have a feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange".
