title: Currently in Santa Fe, but things are shaking in Québec
---

Currently at the Santa Fe Institute for a one month visit which is already very interesting. But in Québec, the Dynamica group has uploaded a new paper on the arXiv. In [Coexistence of phases and the observability of random graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7983) , we use a version of Antoine's formalism for bond percolation on multitype graphs to investigate "depth-L percolation", where observing one node implies observing his neighbours up to a distance L. Interestingly, extensive components can coexist! Meaning that **monitoring a macroscopic portion of a graph does not prevent a macroscopic event to occur unbeknown to the observer** . In your face NSA!
