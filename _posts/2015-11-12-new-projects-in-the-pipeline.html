	<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00801" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">first</a>
 is a new adaptive network project to describe novel patterns that we found in influenza transmission. The 
	<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08542" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">second</a>
 is a new network analysis algorithm which helps us look at different scales of organization at a glance. We have a lot of cool ideas in the work using this algorithm. Finally, a very interesting ecology project should be online soon. Stay tuned!
