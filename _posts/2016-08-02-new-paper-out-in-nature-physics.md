title: New paper out in Nature Physics
---

My new paper, with Sam Scarpino and Antoine Allard, is now out in [Nature Physics](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys3832.html#access). Main result: Institutions replacing sick workers who stay at home might be driving the spread of influenza. The paper has been gathering a lot of attention, and I especially like the the news articles from [The Irish Times](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/using-substitute-workers-for-sick-staff-spreads-disease-study-finds-1.2741641), [Pacific Standard](https://psmag.com/how-staying-home-from-work-can-spread-disease-4dee9e7575f9#.nmw93dciv), and [Nature Microbiology](https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/users/17778-ben-johnson/posts/11048-send-your-sick-colleague-home-but-don-t-hire-a-replacement).
