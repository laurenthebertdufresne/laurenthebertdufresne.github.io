title: Complex Networks Winter Workshop
---

I am very excited to announce the inaugural Complex Networks Winter Workshop (CNWW) in beautiful Québec city. The CNWW is a collaboration between the University of Vermont Complex Systems Center, the Sentinel North Program of the Université Laval and the Network Science Institute of the Northeastern University. The program is designed for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, young faculty and professionals. The lectures will present open problems and recent advances in the field of complex networks. Participants will collaborate in small transdisciplinary research groups involving other participants as well as faculty. 

This will be a fun and intense experience! Culturally, intellectually, socially, and maybe even weatherwise!

The call for applications will be open until 6 August 2018. [Visit our website and help us spread the word!](http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/cnww/)
