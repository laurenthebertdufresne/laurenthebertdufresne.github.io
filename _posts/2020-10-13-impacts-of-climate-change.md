title: $4M for the impacts of climate change on rural communities
---

Our joint team with researchers from the University of Vermont and the University of Maine was awarded a [$4 million project](https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/vermont-maine-team-awarded-4m-study-climate-impacts-species-and-response-farmers-rural) over fours year. The team will develop a spatiotemporal dataset and modeling framework to understand shifts in species range due to climate change, as well as the impacts on rural communities through changes in infectious diseases, pests and local climate. "Communities adapt when they face public crises like climate change or infectious diseases,” Hébert-Dufresne said. “Solving climate change and infectious diseases will involve bottom-up behavior changes and innovations, not just top-down policies."
