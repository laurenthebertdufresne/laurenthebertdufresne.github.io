The summer has been surprisingly more than I expected (in all aspects). And even more surprisingly, I managed to get some work done. Some new publications are in submission and the latest work of [dynamica](http://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/) can now be found on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5768) (as seen at NetSci 2012!).
