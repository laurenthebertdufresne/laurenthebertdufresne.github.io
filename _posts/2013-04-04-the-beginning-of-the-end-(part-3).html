. Most interesting result (for me): a treatment regime minimizing risk of resistance emergence is obtained analytically without considering any network structure, yet the result is valid for simulations on heterogeneous networks (even though the epidemic threshold of the resistant strain depends highly on this heterogeneity of the contact structure).
