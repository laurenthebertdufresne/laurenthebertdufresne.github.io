The always eloquent Thilo Gross wrote a really simple and interesting piece for Nature Physics titled [Complex networks: Don't call in sick](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v12/n11/full/nphys3939.html?WT.ec_id=NPHYS-201611). The article covers our recent [Nature Physics paper](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v12/n11/full/nphys3832.html) as well as the role of applied network science in general. Highly recommended.
