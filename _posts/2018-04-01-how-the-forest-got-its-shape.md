title: How the forest got its shape
---

Our paper on forest ecology, and probably my first project without networks, was just published in [Ecology Letters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ele.12942). This work was started in 2014 with Andrew Berdahl, Uttam Bhat and Sid Redner at the Santa Fe Institute. We demonstrate the link between forest shape and forest stability to help people infer the resilience of individual forests to fires in surrounding grasslands based on their shape!
