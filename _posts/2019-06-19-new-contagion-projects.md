title: New contagion projects
---

We released a few pre-prints of our latest projects on contagions and infectious diseases. We have a theoretical project showing that [interacting contagions look a lot like complex contagions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01147), and a more applied project looking at [the importance of community engagement in stopping the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661959v1). We are also very proud of releasing all the [data collected in this community engagement efforts](https://figshare.com/articles/Social_Mobilization_Action_Consortium_Community_Engagement_data_from_the_2014-2016_Sierra_Leone_Ebola_outbreak/8247002).
