The [NetSci 2020](https://netsci2020.netscisociety.net/) conference wrapped up yesterday. Our Laboratory for Structure & Dynamics (LSD) was well represented with posters by Mariah Boudreau ([sensitivity of probability generating functions](/file/MCBoudreau_NetSci2020Poster.pdf)) and Sam Rosenblatt ([improved acquaintance immunization](https://speakerdeck.com/sfrosenb/strategic-synchronous-snowball-sampling-immunization-netsci-2020)), presentations by Jean-Gabriel Young (higher-order networks), Guillaume St-Onge ([seeding complex contagions](https://dynamicalab.github.io/assets/pdf/slides/netsci2020_slides_sto.pdf)) and Alexander Daniels (network comparison and embedding). We even had a poster on the [network structure of hockey fights](/file/HockeyFights_NetSci2020Poster.pdf), work from our Complex Network Winter Workshop 2019! A good year despite the terrible situation.
