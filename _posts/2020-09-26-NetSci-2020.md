title: NetSci 2020: Network comparison, epidemics, and hockey fights
---

The [NetSci 2020](https://netsci2020.netscisociety.net/) conference wrapped up yesterday. Our Laboratory for Structure & Dynamics (LSD) was well represented with posters by Mariah Boudreau (sensitivity of probability generating functions) and Sam Rosenblatt (improved acquaintance immunization), presentations by Jean-Gabriel Young (higher-order networks), Guillaume St-Onge (seeding complex contagions) and Alexander Daniels (network comparison and embedding). We even had a poster on [pdf](/file/HockeyFights_NetSci2020Poster.pdf), work from our Complex Network Winter Workshop 2019! A good year despite the terrible situation.
