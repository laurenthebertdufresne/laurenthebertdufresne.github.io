title: Two great papers out in PRE
---

My latest work with Antoine Allard and the rest of our group --- our Hard-core Random Networks with arbitrary degree distribution and k-core decomposition, and a cool solution of network observability in terms of multitype graphs --- have been published in Phys. Rev. E. Cool results? The first work captures some structural features of the notoriously hard to model power grids and the second shows how a macroscopic observation of the system does not necessarily stop macroscopic events from being unnoticed. The papers can be found [here](http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v88/i6/e062820) and [here](http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v89/i2/e022801) (with editor's suggestion!).
