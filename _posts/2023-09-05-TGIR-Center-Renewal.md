We received [news last month](https://vermontbiz.com/news/2023/september/05/major-uvm-research-endeavor-receives-115-million-award) that our Translational Global Infectious disease Research (TGIR) Center was renewed for another five years with a generous award from the NIH. I will continue serving as Director for our Mathematical & Computational Predictive Modeling Core.
