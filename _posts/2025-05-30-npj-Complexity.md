Over the last three years, I have been working with the Nature Portfolio to launch [npj Complexity](https://www.nature.com/npjcomplex/); a Nature Partner Journal focused on all complexity and complex systems research.

We had a soft launch back in 2023 and started publishing last year, in time for [NetSci 2024](https://netsci2024.com/en) which we organized, sponsored, and hosted in Qu√©bec. The journal has been growing strong and we are now celebrating our first official anniversary with special [collections](https://www.nature.com/npjcomplex/collections) on artificial life, information warfare, and group decision-making.

P.S. News here are sporadic: Efforts related to npj Complexity can be found on the [journal homepage](https://www.nature.com/npjcomplex/), while updates related to my research group are on the websites of our [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/), [TGIR Center](https://www.med.uvm.edu/tgircobre/home) or [Vermont Complex Systems Institute](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/).
