Over the last three years, I have been working with the Nature Portfolio to launch [npj Complexity](https://www.nature.com/npjcomplex/); a Nature Partner Journal focused on all complexity and complex systems research.

Efforts related to npj Complexity can be found on the [journal homepage](https://www.nature.com/npjcomplex/), updates related to my research group on the [Joint Lab website](https://joint-lab.github.io/),
