title: Road trip and NetSci 2013
---

I'll be AFK from mid-May for a road trip in Iceland, but will reconnect as soon as we get to Copenhagen for [NetSci 2013](http://netsci2013.net/wordpress/) . I'll be giving a talk on a small project called Hard-core Random Networks on a model of random networks which preserves a given shell decomposition structure, maps to a weird version of the Configuration Model and is a quite efficient proxy for analytical predictions of bond percolation. Antoine Allard will be presenting his much broader analytical formalism for bond percolation on any kind of random networks (including the hard-core ones) and Jean-Gabriel Young will present part of his on-going work on community detection (different from the COMPLEX 2012 talk).
