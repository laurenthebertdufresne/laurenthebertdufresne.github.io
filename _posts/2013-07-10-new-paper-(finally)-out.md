title: New paper (finally) out
---

Our new paper, [Global efficiency of local immunization on complex networks](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130710/srep02171/full/srep02171.html) , was published today in Nature's open access (!) journal: Scientific Reports. This is a side project that started almost two years ago with Antoine Allard and Jean-Gabriel Young. This paper had a torturous development, but thanks to [The Long Road](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b33vOZKcS0) , is now much more complete. In fact, there's a new (nice) result on a change in the "characteristic scale" of epidemic dynamics under change of transmissibility.
