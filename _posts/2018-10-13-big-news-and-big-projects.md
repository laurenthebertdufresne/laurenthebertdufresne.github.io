The Vermont Complex Systems announced two large funding news over the last two weeks. First, we are partnering with MassMutual to expend our research on the data science of public health under their generous [$5 million gift](https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/massmutual-and-uvm-expand-groundbreaking-data-science-partnership). Second, NIH has granted us a [$12.3 million COBRE award](https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/123-million-nih-grant-establishes-translational-global-infectious-disease-research) to fund our new Translational Global Infectious Disease Research (TGIR) Center for the multidisciplinary study of infectious diseases. This award will fund my group's continued effort to better understand the role of contact structure and human behavior on epidemics. You can expect us to open new PhD and Postdoctoral positions soon!
